# Week 4: Data Structures, Java Utilities & Algorithm Analysis

Welcome to the repository for **Week 4** of our Java learning journey. This week we focused on important data structures like stacks, queues, and hash maps, explored file and string handling utilities in Java, and ended with essential algorithmic concepts like searching and time complexity.

## üìñ Overview

In Week 4, we explored foundational data structures and Java utility classes that power real-world applications. We practiced implementing and using stacks, queues, and hash maps. Later in the week, we dove into searching and sorting algorithms and wrapped up with a strong theoretical grounding in algorithm analysis using Big-O notation.
